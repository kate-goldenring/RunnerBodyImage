This program quantifies the extent to which runners are encouraged to strive for a runner's body by tracking potentially harmful body negative key words on various runners sites

** This is a first draft **

This is serving as a data analysis portion of a term paper I am writing for a food studies class at UNC Chapel Hill. My paper is discussing the Female Athlete Triad, a medical condition where female atheletes exhibit amenorrhea, bone loss, and disordered eating due to their athletic endeavors
Female distance runners are at a particular risk of contracting the Female Athlete Triad due to the belief that lower body fat percentage leads to faster performance.
Consequently, many runner's websites encourage diets along with workout routines. 


The purpose of this program is to extract text from a series of running websites and 
collect data on the number of occurrences of specific body negative words
and record the sites at which they occur. As of now, the program displays a bar chart with data from two running sites. 

In addition to this data analysis, my ultimate goal is to create a google chrome extension that rates a web-page's body positivity 
using this count and replaces these words with new more positive words. The extension could also provide links to sites with positive body ideals!
